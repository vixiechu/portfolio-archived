<h2>&#9824; Performance &amp; Optimisation &#9824; </h2>   

<h2 class="blog-inner">Code</h2>
    <p> I used a free, open-source editor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brackets_(text_editor)"> (Brackets"</a>) to build my portfolio website, and the first step was to focus on the structure and basic layout to create my HTML5. I already had most of the site content complete and ready for use, so I had time to focus on the semantic structure. </p>
    
    <p> Once I had added in all my content and checked my HTML was <a href="https://validator.w3.org/"> valid</a>; it was time to focus on the styling. I created a stylesheet and began first adding in overall styles; for tags such as page header, body, h1, h2. This is when I had to use implement my first class; allowing the heading tags that appeared within the blog posts to behave and appear differently to those which appeared on the outside of the post. I designed my stylesheet to reflect the colour scheme of my <a href="media/axure-wireframes.png"> wireframes</a>, using my Moodboard as a reference basis.  </p>

<h2 class="blog-inner">Optimisation</h2>    
    <p> While programming my site, I made sure I was frequently running my code through the <a href="https://validator.w3.org"> W3C Validator</a>; this was so I could ensure that my coding was following the best practices for the web. The validator directs you to the error; which is ideal if you like to fix errors as you build (like I do). I wanted to make my portfolio as accessible as possible to the widest range of users; as<a href="https://alistapart.com/article/planning-for-accessibility"> this article</a> helped me to understand. </p>
    
    <p> To improve my sites performance, I created and optimised all my images for web use in Adobe Photoshop CC 2015. I wanted to create my own banner &amp; logo image (which I’ve previously discussed earlier on this blog), but I needed to make sure they appeared correctly, with alt text clearly stating what they are (for users with <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/screenreader">screen readers</a>). I created and optimised my images to the resolution I would want them to display as, (e.g. my <a href="media/VMsq.png">square logo</a> is 200 x 200 to be used as an avatar/smaller icon). </p>

<h2 class="blog-inner">SEO</h2> 
    <p> Once I’d completed my coding &amp; optimisation, I had to think about the SEO integration of my site. I wanted to improve the chance of my site appearing in Google search results when my name was entered; ensuring I focused on the most up to date techniques for SEO. For example, including an overly long page title and headings that contain keywords would <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/top-ranked-sites-google"> negatively impact my website</a>. I wanted my meta description to be concise, efficient and accurate. </p>
