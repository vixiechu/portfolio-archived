 <h2>&#9824;Portfolio Changes (Current &amp; Proposed)&#9824;</h2>   
    <h2 class="blog-inner"> Feedback Received</h2>
<p>In terms of content, my original portfolio succeeded quite well. However, in terms of accessibility and usability there were some issues. The main one was that I included my entire blog one on page, making it extremely long winded and hard to distinguish which blog began and finished where (short of being prudent with the heading indicators). <br>Another issue was the original font I used for my headings (Barrio) wasn’t too accessible. Some characters were augmented strangely and displayed as quite congested on smaller devices; it was especially tricky for users with impairments to their vision or those who have visual difficulties. </p>

<p>I changed the heading font to a clear, sans-serif font ‘Abel’, and it displays clearly on all devices; with no congested characters or inconsistency. It is crisp and clear and compliments ‘Darius’ which is used for the content. </p>
 
<p><img class="blog-img" src="media/newheader.png" alt="A snippet showing the current header for reference"></p>        

<p>The blog pages have been reworked, to include links to each Blog post and their title, in reverse chronological order, meaning the first is at the bottom; this is because most users want to see the most recent news and information first, and will delve further if they so wish to. <br>
The colour contrasting was fine (as seen below), so I’ve kept the colour scheme as it is for now. </p>

    
<h2 class="blog-inner">Proposed Changes</h2>
<p>When the initial changes were made to my portfolio, I was still working on my two self-initiated projects (<a href="blogsix.html">CSS Grid Layout</a> &amp; <a href="blogfive.html">CSS Animation</a>) and learning how to understand and apply SCSS and better CSS techniques. Now they are complete, I have a world of ideas on how to make my portfolio site much better sparked by the new skills I have learnt.</p>
        <p>I intend to restructure the whole website using CSS Grid layout, focusing firstly on my project and blog pages. I also want to incorporate the CSS Animation I have learnt onto the website to add more personality and character – such as on the social media icons. I also intend to create a better logo, as for now I have just optimised the current banner image so it does not display blurred as it did previously. </p>
        
<p>Through completing my final year project (<a href="">Pilgrim Tiles</a>), I have learned how to make an animated hamburger menu with CSS and paired with my recent learned skills in SCSS and CSS Grid, this means I want to change the Navigation layout of my portfolio site completely. As I have learnt a lot more about the CSS language from resources like CSS-tricks and lecture materials, I am going to completely break down and change the website styling.  I also wish to link to more of my personal life to my portfolio; like my hobbies and interests (i.e. writing, video game streaming, my personal blog).</p>

        <p> However, if I’m honest – I’m a little shy when it comes to sharing my writing, so I’m going to have to invest some serious time after I graduate University into making that happen. I want those who visit my portfolio to see who I am in terms of skills and abilities, but also who I am as an individual too (I am a lot more than a big fan of purple – I promise!). </p>
