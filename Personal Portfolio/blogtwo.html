<h2>&#9824; Building my Portfolio &#9824; </h2>

<h2 class="blog-inner"> Inspiration</h2>

    <p> After toying with a few ideas of how I wanted my site to look, I decided to seek some real inspiration. I searched for portfolio ideas on Google, and I came across Creative Bloq’s <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/portfolios/examples-712368"> 50 brilliant design portfolios to inspire you</a>.  I was keen to discover how web designers expressed both their professional skills and individuality simultaneously, and what kind of personal avatar images they decided on. I wanted my portfolio to have a personal touch; inspired by some of my own preferences and hobbies. I wanted to convey my individuality alongside my skills, as similar to <a href="https://inspiredology.com/websites-with-that-personal-touch"> many other users globally;</a> I like be reminded that there is a real human being behind all that technology!  </p>

<h2 class="blog-inner"> The Design </h2>

    <p> I designed my portfolio to be responsive, as I came to understand through my research (and with the help of <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design"> this article)</a>, that most users spend a high percentage of their time browsing on mobile devices. In 2014, <a href="media/mobile-usage.png"> mobile device usage actually overtook desktop usage,</a> and the rise has shown no signs of slowing yet. I converted my paper sketches into wireframes using Axure RP 8.</p>

    <p><img class="blog-img" src="media/axure-wireframes.png" alt="Image of wireframes created by vix morrigan on Adobe Axure" width="960" height="492"></p>

    <p>I found Axure easy to work with, as the elements available are varied and easy to manipulate; meaning my time was spent more efficiently. Once I created the wireframes, I had to choose the typography and colours. I initially wanted to use an 8-bit inspired font face; however it didn’t look as nice as I’d hoped, so I explored the catalogue Google Fonts offer and after exploring a few (hundred) font combinations; I settled on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Delius"> Delius</a> for the main font, and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barrio"> Barrio</a> for the headings.  I knew I wanted to use Google fonts, as they offer cross-platform compatibility and have a broad range of typefaces available. </p>
    
    <p> In terms of colour scheme; I was certain I wanted to incorporate purple throughout my portfolio site, as alongside being my favourite colour; it symbolises ambition, independence, creativity and wisdom <a href="http://www.color-wheel-pro.com/color-meaning.html"> (among other things)</a>. I incorporated my chosen colour scheme into my banner and logo design (discussed in a previous blog) so my site would flow and appear the same throughout the content. To help me visualise my colour scheme; I developed Moodboards that I created using <a href="https://www.easel.ly/"> Easel.Ly. </a> I have used this website a few times throughout my course and for my job as a social media marketer. It is completely free, you can upload and use your own images (if required) and you can save your creations online; allowing easy, remote access. </p> 
    
<h2 class="blog-inner"> The Structure </h2>
    
    <p> I used an open source editor that is free to download (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brackets_(text_editor)">Brackets</a>) to structure my site, using HTML5 and later adding CSS. I enjoy working with Brackets as you can change the theme of the program to black (which saves my eyes!), and I feel comfortable using it. I’ve used it throughout my course and it’s not let me down yet and I really appreciate the live preview function it offers – very handy when it comes to the styling phase! </p>
    
    <p> I focused on the structure and layout of my portfolio site and its content using HTML5 only at first, ensuring to consistently run my code through the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Validator. </a> Once happy with my structure, I was able to focus on the styling of my site. Even though I already knew the hex codes of the colours I’d be using, I still spent a lot of time ensuring they worked well together and were applied in the right place. I used styling techniques,  such as float-image and padding to ensure the content displayed how I wanted, on both desktop and mobile devices. </p>
    
    <p> Creating my portfolio has taught me a lot about web development; not only through the research I conducted, but also through the errors I encountered. I’d be lying to you if I said coding my CSS was all fun and games, not only was it a case of inner perfectionist <strong>versus</strong> trial and error; it also taught me that sometimes, you have no option but to remain light hearted... </p>
