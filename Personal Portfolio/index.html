    <h2> Gamer, Animal Lover &amp; Aspiring Front End Developer </h2> 
    
    <p>I first discovered my interest in Web Development when I was ill and stuck at home a few years back. I needed something to occupy my mind while I recovered; so, I self-taught some HTML5! This choice ultimately lead me to embark on the BSc Web Development course at Manchester Metropolitan University, of which I am in my final year. Making the decision to leave a successful career in finance, follow my heart and study something I found challenging and enjoyable was very nerve-wracking!  
</p>

<p> Once University began, I was incredibly eager to start expanding my knowledge and I quickly realised the nerves I initially felt stemmed from wanting to succeed in a new and exciting area; one that would consistently challenge me and allow me to experience the digital world from a different, more professional perspective. I purchased the <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Web-Design-with-HTML-CSS-JavaScript-and-jQuery-Set-Jon-Duckett/9781118907443?ref=grid-view&qid=1510307449532&sr=1-1" >Jon Duckett </a>books in my first year to help me further understand the languages I was learning, and the rest, as they say is history!
    </p>

<p> Although currently working in social media, I aspire to obtain a career in Front End Development or UXD. I find both of these topics not only interesting, but incredibly insightful.  I enjoy UXD, as there is so much insight and knowledge to be gained from the simplest of things; such as user habits, journeys and application efficiency. Relating to Front End web development, I enjoy utilising the programming languages that I have learnt so far, and applying them to one another successfully, and I'm certain that I would enjoy a career where I could put these skills into practice daily. 
</p>
     
<p> Examples of my work can be found<a href="projects.html"> here.</a> </p>

 

<h2>Personal Life</h2>

<p>Iâ€™m a <strong>huge</strong> animal lover, an avid reader and a major fan of <a href="http://www.listchallenges.com/tartanasia">East Asian Cinema</a> (as with most films, typically the horror genre!) Some might say the company I choose to keep is unusual, as I share my home with 4 Royal Pythons, 2 Cats and a Leopard Gecko; although strange to some, I'm proud to call them my little family.   </p>

<p> I work in Social media management, currently running the social media accounts and pages for a local family-owned business; <a href="https://periodhomestyle.co.uk/">Period Home Style.</a> Working in this field has expanded my understanding of not only social media, but of users and their habits and contrary to my initial expectations; I really enjoy working in this field, from managing &amp; creating content to responding to audience engagement.         </p>
