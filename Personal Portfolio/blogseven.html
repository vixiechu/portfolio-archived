<h2>&#9824; Logo &amp; Banner Creation &#9824; </h2>   

    <p>I’m the first to admit I’m not the biggest fan of using Adobe Photoshop (version: CC 2015), with that being mentioned, I must admit that I’ve grown to appreciate it a lot more. Granted, my experience of it was very limited until I began my course in 2015; I always thought it was an easy excuse to take lower quality photos, but I do stand entirely corrected.  It is an excellent piece of software; especially when enhancing images for the web. There’s lots of useful articles and guidelines available online that can help you to understand why optimisation is important, such as <a href="http://madefreshly.com/blog/howto/how-to-properly-optimize-images-for-web-in-photoshop/"> this one.</a></p>

    <p>While using Photoshop, I learnt a lot of things (including the importance of preserving the original image, and working from a copy… again!). For example, I used <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P"> this font;</a> which I had to download from google and install to Adobe Photoshop. I originally opted to use a free online logo creator, but the image quality was incredibly poor, and it ultimately looked blurry; regardless of my attempts at optimisation. I used the one I created online as a basis; but decided to remove the background entirely as it was originally shrouded in a rectangular shape. I removed this, so that the logo would sit on a background decided by my CSS; meaning it would *hopefully* display well on my website. </p>
<p>I mostly used the following tools to create my logo; transform &amp; free-transform, scale, text input, and paint bucket. I already knew the hex codes of the colours I wanted to include (picked from my <a href="http://09273829.webdevmmu.uk/index.html"> website</a>), so I had to manually input them into the colour picker. </p>

<h2 class="blog-inner">Inspiration</h2>

    <p>My logo was inspired by the 8-bit video games of the 70s &amp; 80s; for which I will always have a special place in my heart. (If you’re interested and have a few spare minutes, here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifXr7LORNCo"> Popular Top 10 8-bit games</a> video to watch!) I chose this style as it reflects one of my dearest passions; video gaming. I’ll never forget when I first played the <a href="http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/2600/a3000.html">Atari 3000</a> with my parents at 3 years old, nor will I forget how difficult some of the games were! I wanted to ensure I included a bit of personality into the banner &amp; logo of my website. </p>
    
    <p> For the banner, I wanted to create a longer image with the intention of it sitting across the top of the page you are currently on; and this gave me a little more room to play with in terms of pixel size. It is 1000 x 250; but designed to optimise depending on the users screen size. You can see this at the <a href="http://09273829.webdevmmu.uk/blog.html"> top of this page. </a> I created a simpler, square design with a resolution of 200 x 200. Maybe for use as a potential avatar, or maybe even a blog sign off… </p>
