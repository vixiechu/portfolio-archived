 <h1> PROJECTS </h1> 

<h2>Web Technologies - iSongs</h2>  
<p>For one of my Level 4 assignments, I was required to create a working online store, similar to <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/itunes/">iTunes</a>, where people could browse a library of available music, as well as having the option to register their own user account. I built this using PHP &amp; MySQL, which we were the programming languages we were learning at the time. I found the languages initially tricky to master; but with applied practice I was able to successfully complete my assignment; obtaining a First as my overall grade. I didn't add any CSS to this; as I wanted to focus on the functionality and ensure the structure was correct. I will add a nice CSS layout in the future. </p>

<h2>Web Programming - Learning JavaScript</h2>
<p>For my Level 5 assignment, we had to learn JavaScript and the assignment was made up of three tasks. I found this assignment challenging and it involved <strong>a lot</strong> of trial and error; but I managed to obtain a First in this project too; which I was incredibly pleased about and if I'm honest, a little shocked! It shows the hard work really paid off! </p>

</ul>

<h2>Web Site Development - YMcr?</h2>
<p>For Level 5 Web site development, I was required to work as part of a team to develop our own website idea centred around student life, and we opted on creating an online student guide; detailing the perks of studying at Manchester Metropolitan University and of Manchester itself as a place to live &amp; study. This assignment was very enjoyable, and I believe that our team worked and communicated well and efficiently managed our time; which made for a more engaging project.  </p>
