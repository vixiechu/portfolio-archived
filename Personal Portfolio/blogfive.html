<h2>&#9824;CSS Animation&#9824;</h2>
    <h2 class="blog-inner">Aim &amp; Objectives</h2>
    <h3>Aim</h3>
    <p>&#9824;To create an animation using CSS Animation; featuring a cute bat character that is dozing off and starting back awake on a loop.</p>
    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>To learn SCCS &amp; CSS3 and expand Understanding</li>
    <li>To research and understand colour schemes better</li>
    <li>To practice the elements required and build the character</li>
    <li>To test the animation and host it on Codepen</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="blog-inner">What is CSS Animation?</h2>
    
    <p>CSS animations make it possible to animate transitions from one CSS style to another fluidly. CSS Animations consist of two components, a style describing the CSS animation and a set of keyframes that indicate the start and end states of the animation's style, as well as possible intermediate waypoints if, as and when required. </p>
    
    <h2 class="blog-inner">Researching CSS Animation &amp; SCSS</h2>
    
    <p>CSS Animation animates without the use of Java or Flash – which is not only impressive but offers quite a stable animation as the final output.  I must admit, I had a lot of fun when looking for inspiration on CSS Animations (this <a href="https://codepen.io/ajerez/pen/EaEEOW">adorable Submarine</a> being one of my favourites) as there is so many wonderful things that can be done with it. </p>
    
    <p>Once I stopped being in awe of all the cute creatures and beautifully fluid transitions I was witnessing, I turned to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp">W3Schools</a> as my first port of call. This is where I learnt about the keyframes element. </p>
    
    <p><img class="blog-img" src="media/bartok.PNG" alt="A still image of Bartok - the CSS Animation bat Vix Morrigan made"></p>
    
    
    <p>For research into SCSS, I found this <a href="http://www.joeloliveira.com/2011/06/28/the-ampersand-a-killer-sass-feature/">great article</a>, which helped me to understand the parent and child element and where I needed to semantically put the code for it to work successfully. As I have prior knowledge in CSS, I just needed to fully grasp the integration of the new rules and features of SCSS. Codepen was also incredibly useful for seeing how this works when applied. </p>
    
    <p>I also used <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Tips">developer.mozilla.org</a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/animation/">CSS-tricks</a> to ensure I fully understood the keyframes element and the structure required to build and run a successful animation. As I wanted to create an animated bat that dozed off and startled awake on a loop, I had to figure out which elements needed to do what; Were any stationary? Where did I want the bat to be? </p>
    
    <h2 class="blog-inner">Applying CSS Animation</h2>
    
    <p>I needed to structure the bat properly, ensuring I had all the visible elements required. After spending (maybe a little too much time) looking at the structure of a bats face, I decided that I would need three elements as pairs; eyes, ears and wings. I would also need the bat’s overall structure, the face and nose, and any added features. </p>
    
    <p><img class="blog-img" src="media/batstructure.PNG" alt="a snip of vix morrigans coding bat structure"></p>
    
    <p>I also needed to make sure I was naming elements correctly, so it was easier when it came to the styling (a lesson I learnt previously – those damn curly boys!). </p>
    
    <p>Once this was done, I opted for colours that were bat-like (purple is associated with Halloween bats, right?!) and also ones that would compliment the colour scheme on my portfolio website. I intend to have a sub-page with CSS Animations I have made in the future, however I need to build a few more before I apply this change in full!</p>
    
    <p>As it was my first time using CSS Animation, I decided to keep my bat relatively simple, with only two elements that would animate. I also opted to include the background in as part of the animation; allowing me to focus on the individual elements. </p>
    
    <p><img class="blog-img" src="media/batstyling.PNG" alt="snip of vix morrigan's styling code off codepen"></p>
    
    <p>I added styling on the ears and eyes, with ear fuzz (yes, that is the scientific name for it) and a glare on the eye pupils. I also used box-shadow to add a shading for the wings, to show they were two individual elements. I also added a small blob on the eyes to add a bit more character to my bat - who is loosely inspired by <a href="http://studio-ghibli.wikia.com/wiki/Jiji ">JiJi</a> from Kiki’s delivery service. </p>
    
    <p>Once I essentially had my bat, it was time to create animations to do what my bat needed; to have droopy eyelids and pupils that dart around once he wakes up again, This involved what I had learned about @keyframes coming into play, to get the timing of the droopy eyelids to work with the shifting pupils. </p>
    
    <p><img class="blog-img" src=media/doze.PNG alt="keyframe codes and animation code for bat eyelid animation"></p>
    
    <p>I aptly named the eyelid animation doze and set it to ease-in to give a soft effect. I set the different timeframes, so I could achieve the dozing affect. I decided on 5 seconds as it was a sleepy animation; although this may seem a little slow; it gave my desired effect. I changed the style of the height over different keyframes over the 5 second period to give the effect of droopy eyelids. </p>
    
    <p><img class="blog-img" src=media/wakeup.PNG alt="keyframe codes and animation code for bat pupil animation"></p>
    
    <p>I named the pupil animation wake up and set it to infinite. I did not use ease-in as I wanted to achieve a sudden, darting effect, as if startled awake.  I decided to use the transform:translate styling option (as this is used to move an element from its current position). 
 I needed to play around a little to ensure the pupils moved after the eyelids lifted back up – after (a lot) of trial and error I managed to get it running how I wanted. 
</p>
    
    <h2 class="blog-inner">Evaluation</h2>
    <p>I really enjoyed learning about SCSS and applying what I had learnt when creating my bat. I wanted to create the bat as I felt it was something that I could show to those in my personal life who aren’t that technologically aware as a demonstration of not only what I can do, but also what you can do through programming. </p>
    
    <p>One of my favourite things that I have discovered through learning CSS Animation and SCSS is using the $variables, specifically $color-name to allocate your colours – this is so much easier than copying and pasting hex codes or playing a small game of memory whilst coding. I have also learnt they can be used in a more advanced way, to <a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/aesthetic-sass-2-colors">create colour palettes for easy reference and styling </a>– which is something I will be doing very soon I assure you! </p>
